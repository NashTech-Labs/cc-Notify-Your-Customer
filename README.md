“Notify your customers on multiple channels using single route.”


# Description:

There are many ways through which organizations can notify their customers for various events like mails, slack channels, phone messages, ticketing systems like freshdesk. Almost every method has api's available, for example, there are api's for mail, slack, twilio, zendesk, freshdesk etc. From a development and maintenance perspective, it is a tough and time consuming task to implement all the api's that are used to send these notifications. Ping is a service that provides few most important and widely used api integrations that can be used by implementing a simple, flexible, fast api that can send multiple notifications asynchroniously in embarrassingly parallel fashion.
